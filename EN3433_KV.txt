Supreme Boon of Intelligence: A Supplication to Red Sarasvatī, Goddess of Melody Namaḥ śrīmāṃ guru sarasvatyai! Your youthful beauty of the three gatherings is replete With countless colorful patterns of utterly perfect conduct. O Bhagavatī Sarasvatī, I beseech you- Bestow on my mind the supreme boon of intelligence! In the endless expanse endowed with all, Like a rainbow of unity painted by Indra's finger, Your body manifests with perfect marks, a mass of coral particles. I beseech you-reveal your form to my naked eyes! Though your speech is forever beyond sound, By strumming the vīṇā of jewel-like vidyā mantras, You wake myriad beings from the sleep of ignorance. I beseech you-suffuse my speech with your melodious song! Even the farthest reaches of space cannot define your construct-free mind That revels in a hundred expressions of wisdom and love. Ultimate vajra, true face of the Goddess of Melody, I beseech you-manifest yourself in my heart! In this way, having blessed my three gates of ordinary delusion As vajra body, speech, and mind, May I grow skilled in gently placing my utpala feet On the crown of countless wisdom-holders' heads! This was uttered spontaneously as it came to mind by the Poet of the Cool Land, a servant who delights of the Goddess of Melody. May this prayer be accomplished just so!
